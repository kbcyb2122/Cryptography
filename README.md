In this am playing the role of a cybersecurity analyst at a Hospital.
Below is a brief of the scenario:

- Unfortunately, one of the hospital's doctors opened up an email containing ransomware. This ransomware spread throughout the hospital and encrypted all of the Patient Records. The ransomware has given two options to decrypt and retrieve the patient records: Either pay 100 bitcoins or solve six riddles.

- The PDF attached is the solution for the above using various Crypography tools such as :
- Encryption
- Decryption
- Caesar Cipher
- Encoding and Decoding
- Binary
- Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption
- Open SSL
- Key/IV
- Public/Private Keys
- Key Distribution
- Hashing
- Hashing Algorithms
- Hashcat
- Steganography
- Steghide.
